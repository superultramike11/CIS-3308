                Function MakeDiv takes in two character strings and returns a div that has the 
                first character string as its innerHTML. Modify function MakeDiv so that it has 
                a local variable (perhaps called currentValue). Set currentValue to the first character
                string. Create a local function named display that places currentValue into the div's 
                innerHTML property. Call this display function (in MakeDiv) before the div is returned.
            </li>
            <li>                
                Add an onclick function to the div so that every time the div is clicked, 
                currentValue alternates between the values of the first and second character 
                string (and display is called again).
            </li>
            <li>
                All your work will be done in function MakeDiv. This index page should be left as is.
            </li>
            <li>
                Testing: when you click on "hot", it should change to "cold". When you click on "cold", 
                it should change back to "hot" again (and keep alternating like this as many times as 
                clicked). Likewise for the other divs...
            </li>
        </ul>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem">
        Note: this exercise is relevant to the sort forward/reverse functionality that you have been asked 
        to implement for your ClickSort Homework. In your CS homework, each &lt;th> tag needs to know 
        whether (when next clicked), it should sort in forward or reverse order. It can do this by having 
        a private local variable that keeps track of this. Your headers (&lt;th> tags) can have local private variables 
        if you use a local function to create them (like function makeHeader in folder 34_clickSort), not 
        as was done (iterating through, not calling a function to make the header, as in folder 36_filter). 
    </p>

    <div id="content" class="container">
    </div>

    <script src="MakeDiv.js"></script>

    <script>

        "use strict"; // turn off the "auto variable declaration" feature of the browser.
        // this makes it so the browser will let us know when we have forgotten to declare a variable, 
        // e.g., if we mispell a variable name. 

        document.getElementById("content").appendChild(MakeDiv("hot", "cold"));
        document.getElementById("content").appendChild(MakeDiv("tall", "short"));
        document.getElementById("content").appendChild(MakeDiv("winter", "summer"));
        document.getElementById("content").appendChild(MakeDiv("black", "white"));
        document.getElementById("content").appendChild(MakeDiv("thin", "fat"));
