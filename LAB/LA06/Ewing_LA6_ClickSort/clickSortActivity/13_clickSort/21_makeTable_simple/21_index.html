        <h3>Make HTML Table (with single data row) from Arbitrary Object</h3>
        <p>
            This code demonstrates the first step in creating an HTML table component from an array of objects. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The component in this example returns an HTML table from a single object. 
                It uses the object's poperty names as column headings, then it creates 
                a single data row that shows the object's data values. 
            </li>
            <li>
                We adhere to the JS file naming convention (the function that creates our component 
                is stored in a JS file named the same as the function and there is no other code 
                in that file). This helps us organize and find our JS functions. It also avoids 
                polluting the global JavaScript name space. 
            </li>
            <li>
                We also adhere to a similar CSS file naming convention. We create a CSS file named 
                the same as the component. All CSS rules in the CSS file begin with a CSS class that 
                is named the same as the CSS file. This helps us organize and find our CSS classes. 
                It also avoids polluting the global CSS name space.
            </li>
        </ul>
