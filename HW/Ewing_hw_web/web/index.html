            <h2>Welcome to the M Records home page!</h2>
    
            <p>
                This site shall be used as full sanctuary for musicians to share
                their creations and for music lovers to truly indulge in an artists presentation.
                M Records will provide with musicians (users) the ability to upload any
                musicial content that they have created. Whether it be an LP, EP, or a new hit single,
                they can upload it here for someone to see. I see this future website as a blend between
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> and the famous underground indie label
                <a href="https://krecs.com/">K Records</a>.

                In terms of my previous web design/development experience, I have taken multiple web design classes
                in High School involving HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of mySQL. In that class, I created an interactive
                page filled with albums that I have loved over the past few years. On the main page you could hover
                over each album cover and it would revealed the contents of what that album is in the first place.
                Other then this high school experience, I have played around with website creation on other platforms,
                but never to the extent of including JavaScript or server-sided content.

                Because of my previous experience with surface-level web design, mostly HTML and CSS, I've found this
                HW to be extremely easy since all my tools have been setup correctly and the instructions are easy to follow.
                But I do expect that it'll get more interesting as we implement more JavaScript and server-side content.
