        <h2>Describe your component</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What it is/does: It will display an album object and provide the user (on hover) the album name and creator name
                in addition to the dynamic rating system that will change colors based on different ratings</li>
            <li>For example if the rating is 80 or above, the rating button for that object will be green signaling a great album.
                For 60 to 70 range, the rating button for that object will be yellow signaling a decent album.
                And finally if it's 50 or below, the rating button for that object will be red signaling a bad album</li>
            <li>I increased the rating increment to +10 each time because I didn't want the user to have to click a million times to actually change the rating color</li>
            <li>How to use it: So the actual component takes in four parameters, the album rating (preferably a number between 0 to 100), an album cover link, an album name, 
                and the album creator name, and side parameter of a style object (which will allow the MakeAlbum contents to change). 
                In addition to this component you can declare an on click button in the HTML page that allows you to increment any specified object you have possibly created
                (full explanation of the on click button creation will be explained in code snippet below)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Describe and link to 3-5 CODE SNIPPETS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>#1 Code Snippet: <a href="https://pastebin.com/6mSS1eKf" target="_blank">Function to get the album rating</a></li>
            <li>#1 Explaination: This private function intakes a possible album rating number and based on the value it determines the specific classList,
            so if the ratingNum is greater then 80, the button from the object will turn green, if the ratingNum is greater then 60, the button will be yellow,
            if the ratingNum is less then 60, the button will be red. Additionally, I have a public function that allows you get directly get the album rating of an object
            and change it to a desired number</li>
            <li>#2 Code Snippet: <a href="https://pastebin.com/pxH2cBrS" target="_blank">Main Button to alter album rating state</a></li>
            <li>#2 Explaination: On click, we take the first album and apply the getAlbumRating (see above code snippet to understand what this function does),
                which parses the argument for an integer. Inside this parsing of the integer we apply a query selector with the proper type aka a button to the first album object.
                Once we confirm this query selector (which looks for the button) we apply that to the innerHTML object so that we know the current value.
                Finally once we get the main rating value we just add 10 to each button click</li>
            <li>#3 Code Snippet: <a href="https://pastebin.com/tPSMT4YH" target="_blank">Main Creation of the MakeAlbum function</a></li>
            <li>#3 Explaination: This code is where we actually declare two album objects and add them to the content tag on our HTML page.
            First we declare the dataset to be sent to the MakeAlbum (I send two albums of similar content) with the following parameters 
            (an album cover, the album rating which is an integer, the album author and the album name). 
            Since we now have the dataset of each object, we can send this data to the MakeAlbum as parameters, in addition to a styleObj that can take in attributes like "thumbnailHover".
            Finally once we declare these two instances of MakeAlbum, we can add them to the main HTML page inside the section that has the style id "content".</li>
